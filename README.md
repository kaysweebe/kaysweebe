- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kaysweebe
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing my skillset
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning flutter, react, node.js, graphql, aws, gcp and much more

This is a brand new repo with brand new projects. Some things I've worked on in here are:
- Hacker Rank Questions: Each section contains a problem statement, my solution, and some tests.
- SpaceX: Chakra UI frontend with theme, Apollo client points to a public GraphQL API to get rocket data.
- Set up Docker, React, Typescript: Simple code to get started with a Dockerfile and a typescript React App.
- Docker PostgreSQL: How-To to quickly get started with a PostgreSQL database in Docker.
- Bookshelf: I want to use this as my creative UI space. There isn't much to this right now.
