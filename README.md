- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kaysweebe
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing my skillset, traveling the world, and making a difference in my community
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning flutter, react, node.js, graphql, aws, gcp and much more
- ðŸ’• My favorite 'work' book has been The End of Average

This is a brand new repo with brand new projects. Some things I've worked on in here are:
- Pixel Playground: An online space for couch-play games. Currently has tic-tac-toe and connect 4. I add games to play with my son. If you have a couch-play game request I would be willing to add it!
- Hacker Rank Questions: Each section contains a problem statement, my solution, and some tests.
- SpaceX: Chakra UI frontend with theme, Apollo client points to a public GraphQL API to get rocket data.
- Set up Docker, React, Typescript: Simple code to get started with a Dockerfile and a typescript React App.
- Docker PostgreSQL: How-To to quickly get started with a PostgreSQL database in Docker.
- Bookshelf: I want to use this as my creative UI space. There isn't much to this right now.
